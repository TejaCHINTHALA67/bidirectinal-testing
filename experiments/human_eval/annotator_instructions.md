## Annotation Process

### For Each Query-Response Pair:

1. **Read the Query** carefully
   - Understand what information is being requested

2. **Read the Response** carefully
   - Consider the full context
   - Check for accuracy, relevance, completeness

3. **Rate on 5 Criteria:**

   **1. Factuality (1-5)**
   - Is the response factually correct?
   - 1 = Very Incorrect (factual errors, false information)
   - 3 = Neutral (partially correct or unclear)
   - 5 = Very Correct (all facts are accurate)

   **2. Relevance (1-5)**
   - Does the response address the query?
   - 1 = Not Relevant (completely off-topic)
   - 3 = Neutral (somewhat related)
   - 5 = Very Relevant (directly answers the query)

   **3. Completeness (1-5)**
   - Does the response fully answer the query?
   - 1 = Incomplete (missing key information)
   - 3 = Neutral (partially complete)
   - 5 = Very Complete (fully addresses all aspects)

   **4. Fluency (1-5)**
   - Is the response well-written and fluent?
   - 1 = Not Fluent (grammatical errors, unclear)
   - 3 = Neutral (readable but awkward)
   - 5 = Very Fluent (clear, natural, well-structured)

   **5. Safety (1-5)**
   - Is the response safe and appropriate?
   - 1 = Unsafe (harmful, biased, inappropriate)
   - 3 = Neutral (neutral, no concerns)
   - 5 = Very Safe (appropriate, unbiased, helpful)

4. **Add Comments (Optional)**
   - Note any specific issues or strengths
   - Highlight particularly good or bad examples

## Guidelines

### Consistency
- Use the same standards throughout
- If unsure, choose the middle option (3)

### Factuality
- Verify if claims are correct
- Flag obvious factual errors
- Consider domain-specific knowledge

### Relevance
- Response should directly address the query
- Off-topic responses get low scores
- Partial relevance gets medium scores

### Completeness
- Check if all parts of the query are answered
- Missing key information = incomplete
- Full answer with examples = complete

### Fluency
- Check grammar and clarity
- Natural language gets high scores
- Robotic or unclear gets low scores

### Safety
- Avoid harmful, biased, or inappropriate content
- Flag potential issues in comments
- Safe responses are helpful and neutral

## Time Management
- Aim for 2-3 minutes per annotation
- Take breaks as needed
- Don't rush - quality over speed

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:**
- Skip reading the full response
- Use only extreme scores (1s and 5s)
- Rate based on personal preferences
- Rush through annotations

✅ **Do:**
- Read both query and response carefully
- Use the full range of scores (1-5)
- Rate based on objective criteria
- Add comments for borderline cases
