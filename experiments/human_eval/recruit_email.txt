Subject: Paid ML Research Annotation - $50 for 2 hours

Hi [Name],

I'm conducting a research study on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for an IEEE publication and need expert annotators to evaluate generated responses.

**Details:**
- **Time Commitment:** 2 hours (flexible schedule)
- **Compensation:** $50 USD (gift card or PayPal)
- **Task:** Rate 100 AI-generated responses on 5 criteria:

  - Completeness (fully answers query)
  - Fluency (well-written)
  - Safety (appropriate content)
- **Platform:** Online web interface (no installation needed)
- **Requirements:** 
  - ML/NLP background (student/researcher/practitioner)
  - Fluent English
  - Attention to detail

**What You'll Do:**
1. Access web interface at provided URL
2. Register with annotator ID
3. Review query-response pairs
4. Rate each response on 5-point Likert scales
5. Option to add comments

**Why This Matters:**
Your annotations will help validate our Bidirectional RAG system against baselines. This is critical for IEEE publication acceptance. Your contribution will be acknowledged in the paper.

**Timeline:**
- Reply by [DATE] if interested
- Receive instructions and access credentials
- Complete annotations within 1 week (flexible)
- Receive compensation within 1 week of completion

**Confidentiality:**

- Any questions

Thank you for considering this opportunity!
